# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game with an extra mode to play rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spook.
In this project, i emphasized on the good use of node modules, proper DOM manipulation and the use of the local storage.
I am yet to complete the multiplayer side of the game but i plan to implement it with the use of web socket
